# Minecraft-Soul-Snatchers-Maps-and-Game-Information

A community project repository to add and have a bunch of Minecraft Soul Snatchers maps for the Bedrock Edition, so that everyone can easily get access to all the maps. The maps are all up to date, with all the commands with appropriate roles, texture pack, and no name tags. I want this project to be where people can add maps that they have, so everyone can have access to them. So if you have any maps, please share. I will have a video down below on how to add files to this project:

Video will be posted soon

# Rules and how to play Soul Snatchers

## How to play Soul Snatchers

Each player will go through the Randomizer, and they will get an item that will say Soul or Trap. The Souls are the hunters; they must capture the Trapped, who are trying to navigate a maze-like building to find the exit. The Souls' objective is to capture the Trapped, while the Trapped's objective is to reach the exit without being captured. In Soul Snatchers two, the rules are pretty much the same, but this time, the Souls hide items that act like keys to open the door to escape. Typically, each Trapped gets 2 lives.

## Rules

1. Gamertags off.

2. The game continues until either the Trapped reach the exit or all of them are captured by the Souls.

3. Soul and Trappers need to be in separate calls. 

# Roles

## Trapped:

The Trapped starts on the top of the building. Their goal is to navigate the maze-like structure to find the exit and reach the end of the game to win while avoiding the souls and not getting caught. They usually have two lives.

## Soul:

The Souls start at the bottom of the map and have to search for the trapped. Their goal is to collect the Traps' souls to win and stop them from reaching the exit.
