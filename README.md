# Minecraft-Soul-Snatchers-Maps-and-Game-Information

A community project repository to add and have a bunch of Minecraft Soul Snatchers maps for the Bedrock Edition so that everyone can easily get access to all the maps. The maps are all up to date, with all the commands with appropriate roles, texture pack, and no name tags. I want this project to be where people can add maps that they have, so everyone can have access to them. So if you have any maps please share. I will have a video down below on how to add files to this project:
